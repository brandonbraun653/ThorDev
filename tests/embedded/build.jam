# Place holder 
# Eventually this file will let you run individual tests on a device, or perhaps even all of them at once.
# I will need to get quite a bit of software linked together though to accomplish that:
#   VisualGDB server/driver/flasher
#   Build the test modules (not hard)
#   Somehow report the testing results back to the user. Currently this is done in Visual Studio Test Explorer.
