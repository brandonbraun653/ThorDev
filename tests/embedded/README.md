All the tests here are intended to be run on the actual DUT using VisualGDB and TinyEmbeddedTest. VS projects
can be found in the dev/VisualStudio/Embedded folder.

If you don't have their software already, I would highly recommend getting it. It's dramatically simplified 
my embedded developer life and helps me quickly get going on writing new modules.
